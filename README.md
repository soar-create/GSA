# GSA: Gradient-based Simulated Annealing for Efficient Rubbish Text Attack

## Usage

Our code can be easily tested via the command-line interface: 
<pre><code>textattack attack --recipe gsa --model distilbert-base-uncased-ag-news --num-examples 500
</code></pre>
This will attack DistilBERT model on AG News dataset using our GSA.
